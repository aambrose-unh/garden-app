**Application Specification: Garden Tracker**

Version: 1.0  
Date: April 3, 2025  
**1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the specifications for the Garden Tracker application. The primary goal of this web-based application is to assist gardeners in managing their garden beds, tracking planting history, and making informed decisions about future plantings based on crop rotation principles and plant characteristics to promote garden health and productivity.

**2\. Goals & Objectives**

* Provide a simple interface for users to define and manage their garden beds.  
* Enable tracking of current and historical plantings within each garden bed.  
* Maintain a database of plant types, including information relevant to spacing and crop rotation.  
* Offer basic recommendations for subsequent plantings to minimize soil depletion and disease.  
* Ensure data persistence and user-specific information management.

**3\. Target Audience**

* Home gardeners (beginner to intermediate) seeking better organization and planning for their vegetable or flower gardens.  
* Community gardeners managing individual plots.

**4\. Functional Requirements**

4.1. User Management  
\* Users must be able to register for an account (e.g., using email and password).  
\* Users must be able to log in and log out.  
\* User data (garden beds, plantings) must be associated with their account and kept private.  
\* (Optional V1.1) Password recovery mechanism.  
4.2. Garden Bed Management  
\* Create Bed: Users can add a new garden bed, specifying:  
\* Name (e.g., "North Raised Bed", "Herb Spiral")  
\* Dimensions (e.g., Length, Width in feet/meters \- user preference setting needed)  
\* Optional: Description/Location notes.  
\* View Beds: Users can see a list or visual representation of all their defined garden beds.  
\* View Bed Details: Users can select a bed to see its details (dimensions, description) and its planting history.  
\* Edit Bed: Users can modify the name, dimensions, or description of an existing bed.  
\* Delete Bed: Users can remove a garden bed (confirmation required). This may also remove associated planting history or require explicit confirmation for that.  
4.3. Plant Information Management  
\* The application will maintain a database of common garden plants.  
\* Each plant entry should include:  
\* Common Name (e.g., "Tomato", "Carrot", "Basil")  
\* Scientific Name (Optional but good for accuracy, e.g., Solanum lycopersicum)  
\* Typical Mature Size/Spacing (e.g., Height, Spread \- needed for layout planning)  
\* Crop Rotation Family/Group (e.g., Nightshade, Root Vegetable, Legume, Brassica). This is crucial for rotation logic.  
\* Brief Description/Notes (Optional: planting tips, sun requirements, etc.)  
\* Initial Population: The database should be pre-populated with a reasonable number of common garden plants.  
\* (Future Enhancement): Allow users to add custom plant types or edit existing ones (requires careful consideration of data integrity for recommendations).  
4.4. Planting History & Tracking  
\* Add Planting: Users can record a planting event for a specific garden bed, specifying:  
\* Plant Type (selected from the Plant Information database)  
\* Year/Season (e.g., "2025 Spring", "2025 Full Season")  
\* Date Planted (Optional)  
\* Quantity/Approximate Area Used (Optional \- helps with future spacing)  
\* Notes (Optional: e.g., "Variety: Beefsteak", "Started from seed")  
\* View History: Users can view the chronological planting history for a specific garden bed.  
\* Mark Current: Ability to easily identify/filter for plants currently growing in a bed for the active season.  
\* Edit/Delete Planting Record: Users can correct or remove past planting records.  
4.5. Planting Recommendations  
\* When viewing a garden bed, the application should provide guidance for the next planting cycle based on its history.  
\* Rotation Logic:  
\* Identify the Crop Rotation Family of the most recent plantings in the bed.  
\* Consult predefined rules (e.g., "Avoid planting Nightshades after Nightshades", "Legumes are good predecessors for heavy feeders like Brassicas").  
\* Suggest suitable plant families or specific plants for the next season.  
\* Warn against planting incompatible successive crops (e.g., same family consecutively).  
\* Spacing Consideration (Basic): When viewing potential plants, display their typical size to help users assess fit within the bed dimensions (detailed layout planning is a future enhancement).  
**5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** The application should load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions under typical load (e.g., \< 2-second response for most actions).  
* **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for non-technical users. Minimal learning curve.  
* **Reliability:** Data should be saved reliably. The application should handle errors gracefully. Regular backups of the database are essential.  
* **Scalability:** The application should be designed to handle a moderate number of users (e.g., thousands) and associated data (dozens of beds, hundreds of planting records per user) without significant performance degradation.  
* **Security:** User authentication must be secure. Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). User data must be isolated.  
* **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured, commented, and follow best practices for React and Python development to facilitate future updates and bug fixes.  
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** The frontend should render correctly on major modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  
* **Responsiveness (Optional V1):** Ideally, the layout should adapt reasonably well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet). Full mobile optimization might be V1.1.

**6\. Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:** React.js (potentially using a framework like Next.js or Create React App)  
* **Backend:** Python (using a web framework like Flask or Django)  
* **Database:** SQL-based Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite for simpler deployments/development)  
* **API:** RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.

**7\. Data Model (High-Level Schema)**

* **Users:** user\_id (PK), email, password\_hash, creation\_date, last\_login, preferred\_units (e.g., 'metric'/'imperial')  
* **GardenBeds:** bed\_id (PK), user\_id (FK), name, length, width, unit\_measure, description, creation\_date  
* **PlantTypes:** plant\_type\_id (PK), common\_name, scientific\_name, description, avg\_height, avg\_spread, rotation\_family, notes  
* **Plantings:** planting\_id (PK), bed\_id (FK), plant\_type\_id (FK), year, season (e.g., Spring, Summer, Fall, Full), date\_planted, notes, is\_current (Boolean flag)  
* **(Potential Future Table) RotationRules:** rule\_id (PK), preceding\_family, succeeding\_family, recommendation\_level (e.g., 'Good', 'Avoid', 'Neutral'), reason
